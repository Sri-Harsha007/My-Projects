Research Internship at Smartron from May 2017 – July 2017

• Worked on a POC for designing the algorithm for smart elevators. Main goal of POC is to develop an algorithm for smart elevators, a
solution to reduce waiting and traveling time of passengers experienced in conventional elevators of large buildings.
• Implemented the POC using Master-Slave configuration on a simulated arduino setup to achieve the same. Handled data and
communication between elevators using a circular queue.
